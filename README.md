###Codebots: a game about coding bots

####Premise
The premise of Codebots is to create a game focused on illustrating how useful and fun programming is in the modern world. There's only so many ways to do "Hello, World!" and none of them are fun. However, having a bot blow up another bot with some simple code, that is fun for everyone.

####Purpose
The purpose of Codebots is two-fold. The primary purpose is to make an educational game about programming that is also fun. The second goal is fulfill the requirnments of my degree program and complete a Capstone project. This software's goal is fulfill both of these purposes.

######Small Notes
- Unity and Git don't get along, when committing, close Unity fully
- Unity's level editor is not amazing, 3DS Max is much better
