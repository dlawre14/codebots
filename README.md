###Codebots: a game about coding bots

####Preface
After working on this project for some time I have realized it is not and never will really be what I envisioned. I have learned a lot about what will and won't work and I do wish to pursue a proper Codebots game in the future. However this game will never be a game that is fun to play or fun to learn from. My goal in this repository is to get the *game* to a playable state. Given much more time, I would start from the ground up with a new set of core mechanics.

I am happy with what I learned here and though there is no final product, I am glad I was able to push this as far as I did.

####Premise
The premise of Codebots is to create a game focused on illustrating how useful and fun programming is in the modern world. There's only so many ways to do "Hello, World!" and none of them are fun. However, having a bot blow up another bot with some simple code, that is fun for everyone.

####Purpose
The purpose of Codebots is two-fold. The primary purpose is to make an educational game about programming that is also fun. The second goal is fulfill the requirnments of my degree program and complete a Capstone project. This software's goal is fulfill both of these purposes.

###Current Implementation Details
- How popups are done is incredibly poor. Much if not all of the GUI popup code could be rewritten and probably should be. As of now I'm going to consider it technical debt as it's not game crticial.

######Small Notes
- Unity and Git don't get along, when committing, close Unity fully
- Unity's level editor is not amazing, 3DS Max is much better
